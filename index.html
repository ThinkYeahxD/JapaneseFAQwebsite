        <p>Japan is made up of four main islands which are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Honshu is the largest
          and most populated island where major cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Hiroshima are found. Japan also has
          more than 14,000 smaller islands. Because Japan is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, it has many volcanoes
          and experiences earthquakes. The country also has four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter.</p>

          flower, and it represents the imperial family.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>A Shogun was a military leader who held real power in Japan, while the emperor was mainly a spiritual figure.
          The Samurai were loyal warriors who served the Shogun and followed the Bushidō code, which means “way of the
          warrior.” Bushidō teaches loyalty, courage, honor, and discipline. Samurai were respected members of society
          and represented bravery and order during Japan's feudal times.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Ninjas, also called Shinobi, were secret agents who worked for powerful lords during Japan's wars. They were
          skilled in spying, disguise, stealth, and self-defense. Unlike samurai who fought with honor, ninjas used
          strategy and surprise to win. They came from farmers and villagers who learned to protect themselves, and
          later became important in gathering information and doing secret missions.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Before eating, Japanese people say “Itadakimasu”, which means “I humbly receive.” After eating, they say
          “Gochisousama deshita”, which means “Thank you for the meal.”<br>Here are some dining rules in
          Japan:<br><br>Slurping noodles is polite because it shows you enjoy the food.<br><br>Do not stick chopsticks
          upright in rice, because it looks like a funeral offering.<br><br>Do not pass food from chopstick to
          chopstick, also related to funeral rituals.<br><br>Use chopstick rests to keep them clean.<br><br>Don't point
          or play with chopsticks.<br>These rules show respect and cleanliness while eating.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">Why is Japan known for being clean?</button>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Cleanliness is very important in Japanese life. People remove their shoes before entering houses to keep
          floors clean. Streets are clean even without many trash bins, because people bring their trash home to throw
          it properly. This practice comes from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that teach purity, respect, and order. Clean
          surroundings show respect for others and for nature. When entering someone's home, people say “Ojama shimasu”,
          meaning “I will be intruding.”</p>

          of desires.<br>Both religions influence Japanese festivals, traditions, and respect for nature. Examples
